# üìª ESP32-C6-Touch Sonos Display

A minimalist ESP32-C6 project that displays information like the current volume of your Sonos speaker on a 1.47" touch display. The screen turns off after 10 seconds of inactivity and wakes up automatically on volume changes. Uses UPnP subscription to listen for `RenderingControl` events from the Sonos speaker every 55 seconds.

I've created this because I missed some visual feedback from my Sonos sound system. This setup allows to receive visual information from your Sonos speakers. It currently only shows volume information but you can now extend this any way you like.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üì¶ Requirements

- Arduino IDE 2.x or later
- ESP32 board manager (with C6 support)
- Arduino libraries:
  - `WiFi`
  - `Arduino_GFX_Library`
  - `lvgl`
  - [`yxml`](https://github.com/JulStrat/LibYxml)

### üîß Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/esp32-c6-sonos-volume.git
   ```
1. Open the `.ino` project in Arduino IDE.
1. Under Settings in the Arduino IDE add `https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json` to the Addtional Boards manager URLs. (comma seperated: `http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json,https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json`)
1. Add the `ESP32 by Espressif` boards via the boards manager
1. Install missing libraries via the Library Manager or manually. (see [requirements](#-requirements) and [external docs and videos](#some-external-documentation-and-youtube-videos-that-have-helped-me-a-lot))

1. Connect your ESP32-C6 board.
1. Under Tools -> Board -> esp32 -> select the  ESP32-C6 Board 
1. Under Tools -> Port -> Select the correct serial port 
1. Under Tools -> set `USB CDC On Boot` to `Enabled`
1. Under Tools -> set `Flash Size` to `8MB (64mb)`
1. Under Tools -> set `Partition Scheme` to `8M with spiffs (3MB APP/1.5MB SPIFFS)`
1. Create a file called `WiFiCreds.h` in the project folder or create a small library in your Arduino/library folder for your personal WiFi credentials:

   ```cpp
   #pragma once
   const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID";
   const char* password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";
   ```
1. Replace `sonosIP` with your Sonos speaker IP.
1. Compile, upload, and monitor the serial output.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**  
> I had a lot off time consuming issues as this was my first esp32 project on MacBook. To save time:
> - If the ESP32 doesn't show up in the Serial Ports (or `/dev/cu.*`) make sure your USB cable is the right one, some cables only provide power but no data. Try different cables!!!
> - On My MacBook I installed [The CP210x USB to UART Bridge Virtual COM Port (VCP) drivers](https://www.silabs.com/developer-tools/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads) which work with USB-C but also via dongles or other usb adapters. I have also tried [the ch34xser_macos Drivers](https://github.com/WCHSoftGroup/ch34xser_macos). But in the end it was the cable and I switched back to the CP210X driver.
> - If in the Serial Monitor you don't see any data check if you have set the `USB CDC On Boot` and other settings correctly under tools.

## üß™ How It Works

- A small HTTP server listens for **Sonos NOTIFY events**
- Every 55 seconds, it **resubscribes** to the speaker‚Äôs `RenderingControl` service
- When a volume change is detected, the screen wakes up and updates
- After 10 seconds of inactivity, the display is turned off to save power

## üßë‚Äçüíª Developer Notes

- The code needs optimization, pull requests are welcome!
- I have merged different demo's, examples and other code into this project. So there may be unused or obsolete code in the project, pull reqests are welcome!
- UI is auto-generated with **SquareLine Studio**
  - Files are located in the `ui/` folder and copied to your project folder (see [videos](#some-external-documentation-and-youtube-videos-that-have-helped-me-a-lot))
- Display driver setup uses `Arduino_GFX_Library`
- Project is built around Arduino‚Äôs event loop using `millis()` for timing
- Parsing of Sonos event XML is done with `yxml`, ensuring a small memory footprint
- Built entirely using Arduino IDE for simplicity and portability
